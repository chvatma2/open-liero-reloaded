# olr-format

Pack authoring formats (spec `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-16-formats-design.md`):
the readable files editors, agents and people write; their canonical text;
compilers to `olr-data`'s runtime structs; lifts back. Plan 13a: mods.

- **Layer 2, `std`.** Depends on `olr-data`, `olr-vfs`, `serde`, `ron`,
  `thiserror`. Tests also use `olr-pack` and `olr-sim` (dev-dependencies).
- **Canonical text** (`ron_io`): `to_canonical`/`from_canonical` are the only
  path between values and text: 4-space indent, no struct names,
  `implicit_some` with no header, defaults left out, a trailing newline.
  Reading canonical text and writing it again gives the same bytes.
- **Defaults compare floats by bits** (`defaults.rs`): `-0.0` is not `0.0`.
- **Never panic on content**; errors are `FormatError` with the file and a
  line and column (parse) or a field path (invalid values).
- **Mods** (`mods/`; names in `docs/porting/olx-notes/mod-fields.md` §13):
  - `ModSource` is a mod as its files hold it: `mod.ron`,
    `weapons/<id>.ron`, `projectiles/<id>.ron` (shared projectiles) and
    `restrictions.ron`. `read_mod_files` and `write_mod_files` move it
    between a `ContentSource`/`ContentSink` and memory; `compile_mod` makes
    the runtime `ModDef`; `lift_mod` goes back.
  - **`deny_unknown_fields` on every type:** a typo is an error. A spawn's
    canonical field order puts its parameters before `shared`/`projectile`.
  - **Key rule.** A shared projectile's key is its file id. An inline
    projectile's key is its `id`, else derived from its place: the weapon
    id for a shot, then `<parent>.spawn` or `<parent>.trail`. Keys matter
    because `SimMod` keeps definitions that name their children by key.
    `lift_mod` shares a projectile that is referenced other than once.
  - **What LX56 cannot express is a compile error:** more than one effect
    per event besides `Spawn`, more than one `Spawn`, events naming
    different spawns, more than one entry in `spawns`, timer effects with
    `after_s` not above 0, a cycle between projectiles, an id used twice.
  - **Context defaults.** `Spawn<C>` takes four defaults from its context
    (`ShotContext`, `EventContext`, `TrailContext`): `relative_to_parent`,
    `speed_var_diagonal`, `random_rotation`, `inherit_velocity`. Imported
    files carry none of them.
  - `LIFTED_SPAWN` (`"spawn"`) is the name `lift_mod` gives a projectile's
    event spawn.
  - `Effect::Disappear` is OLX's `Disappear`, which does not remove the
    projectile; `Effect::Remove` does.
  - **Bounds** (errors, never panics): `MAX_INLINE_DEPTH` (32),
    `MAX_WEAPONS` (512), `MAX_SHARED` (4096), `MAX_EFFECTS` (16 per event),
    `MAX_COLOURS` (256).
  - **Tests.** `tests/equivalence.rs`: the bundled mods, lifted, written,
    read and compiled, give the import back exactly, the same `SimMod`, and
    the same RON text (with snapshots of some files in `tests/snapshots/`).
    `tests/roundtrip.rs`: a proptest that any authoring value round-trips
    through canonical text. `tests/hostile.rs`: deep nesting and mutated
    files give errors, never panics. Unit tests in `compile.rs`, `lift.rs`,
    `files.rs`, `types.rs` and `spawn.rs` cover their rules.
