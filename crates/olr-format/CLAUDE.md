# olr-format

Pack authoring formats (spec `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-16-formats-design.md`):
the readable files editors, agents and people write; their canonical text;
compilers to `olr-data`'s runtime structs; lifts back. Plan 13a: mods.

- **Layer 2, `std`.** Depends on `olr-data`, `olr-vfs`, `serde`, `ron`,
  `thiserror`. Tests also use `olr-pack` and `olr-sim` (dev-dependencies).
- **Canonical text** (`ron_io`): `to_canonical`/`from_canonical` are the only
  path between values and text: 4-space indent, no struct names,
  `implicit_some` with no header, defaults left out, a trailing newline.
  Reading canonical text and writing it again gives the same bytes.
- **Defaults compare floats by bits** (`defaults.rs`): `-0.0` is not `0.0`.
- **Never panic on content**; errors are `FormatError` with the file and a
  line and column (parse) or a field path (invalid values).
